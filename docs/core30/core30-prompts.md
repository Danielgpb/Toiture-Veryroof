Now analyze my business information and create the complete site architecture.

Prompt 1: Skeleton

You are a senior web developer with 15+ years of experience building SEO-optimized local business websites. Your task: build the complete site structure and design system. This prompt is ONLY about architecture — we will add content in subsequent prompts.
=======================================================
SITE ARCHITECTURE — PASTE FROM PROMPT 0
=======================================================
[PASTE YOUR COMPLETE SITE ARCHITECTURE FROM PROMPT 0 HERE]
=======================================================
DESIGN VARIABLES
=======================================================
COLOR SCHEME:
- Primary: #1E3A5F (dark blue)
- Accent: #3B82F6 (bright blue)
- Background: #FFFFFF (white)
- Text: #1F2937 (dark gray)
(Adjust colors above to match your brand)
=======================================================
IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================================
1. Branding & Design
- Use BUSINESS NAME from site architecture
- Use COLOR SCHEME defined above
- Typography: Clean, trustworthy, appropriate for the industry
- Design feel: Professional but approachable local business — not corporate
2. Header
- Top bar: "Serving [CITY], [STATE] & Surrounding Areas" on left, [PHONE NUMBER] on right (click-to-call)
- Main header: Logo on left, navigation center, phone button on right styled as primary CTA
- Sticky header on scroll
3. Navigation
Use NAVIGATION STRUCTURE from site architecture:
- Simple and clean — no dropdowns
- All nav items link to defined URLs
4. Footer
- Phone number prominent (click-to-call)
- Address: [CITY], [STATE] [ZIP CODE]
- Email: [EMAIL]
- Service areas: List all SERVICE AREAS from architecture
- Quick links: Home, Services, About Us, Contact
- Social icons placeholder (Facebook, Google)
- © 2025 [BUSINESS NAME]
5. Mobile Elements
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Floating "Call Now" button (bottom right, always visible)
- Click-to-call on all phone numbers
- Thumb-friendly button sizes
6. Page Creation
Create ALL pages listed in the site architecture:
- Homepage (URL from architecture)
- Main Pages (Services, About, Contact)
- All Secondary Category Pages
- All Core Service Pages
- All Child Service Pages listed under each category/core service
- All General Service Pages
7. Placeholder Content
Each page should display ONLY:
- The page title (e.g., "[Service Name] [City] [State Abbrev]")
- Text: "Content coming soon"
- The header and footer
Do NOT write actual content for any page. We will build that out in subsequent prompts.
8. Services Page Structure
On the /services page, display a complete list of links to ALL service pages, organized by category as defined in SERVICE HIERARCHY. This allows verification that all pages were created.
9. Scroll Behavior (Critical)
When navigating between pages, the browser must scroll to the top of the new page. Implement a ScrollToTop component that resets scroll position to (0, 0) on every route change. Users must always land at the top of each page.
10. Technical Requirements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast loading
- Clean semantic HTML5
- All navigation links working between pages
- Consistent header/footer across all pages
- EVERY page listed in the architecture must be created as an actual route
11. Verification
After creating the site, confirm:
- Total number of pages created matches PAGE COUNT SUMMARY from architecture
- All routes are accessible
- Navigation works correctly
- ScrollToTop is functioning
Generate the complete site structure with all pages created and navigation working. Do not add content beyond the placeholder text specified above.


Prompt 2: GBP Landing Page Content

You are an expert conversion copywriter who specializes in local service businesses. You understand that the homepage exists for ONE purpose: get the searcher to call or submit a form.
You write copy that speaks DIRECTLY to the searcher's problem and positions the business as the obvious choice — not through generic claims, but through specific proof and differentiators.
=======================================================
SITE ARCHITECTURE — PASTE FROM PROMPT 0
=======================================================
[PASTE YOUR COMPLETE SITE ARCHITECTURE FROM PROMPT 0 HERE]
=======================================================
BUSINESS DIFFERENTIATORS — FILL IN
=======================================================
Answer these questions with SPECIFIC, PROVABLE claims. No generic statements.
1. How many 5-star reviews do you have? ___
2. What's your average response time? ___
3. Do you offer free estimates? ___
4. Do you charge a trip fee? ___
5. Are you available 24/7 or after hours? ___
6. How long have you served this area? ___
7. Any guarantees you offer? (satisfaction, price match, warranty) ___
8. What licenses/certifications do you hold? ___
9. Are you locally owned? Family owned? ___
10. What makes you different from the 10 other companies they could call? ___
=======================================================
GOAL COMPLETION FRAMEWORK
=======================================================
Every section answers ONE question in the searcher's mind:
- Hero: "Can you solve my problem right now?"
- Why Choose Us: "Why should I pick YOU over everyone else?"
- Reviews: "Do other people trust you?"
- Services: "Do you handle what I specifically need?"
- FAQ: "What concerns should I have answered before calling?"
The searcher has a problem. They're scanning for PROOF you can fix it.
They don't care about your company history. They care about their problem.
=======================================================
CONTENT TO GENERATE
=======================================================
SECTION 1: HERO CONTENT
H1 Requirements:
- Include [PRIMARY CATEGORY] + [CITY] + [STATE ABBREVIATION]
- Speak to the outcome they want, not just the service
- 60-70 characters max
H1 Formula Options (pick best fit):
- "[CITY]'s Most Trusted [PRIMARY CATEGORY] | [Key Differentiator]"
- "[PRIMARY CATEGORY] in [CITY], [STATE] | [Outcome They Want]"
- "Need a [PRIMARY CATEGORY] in [CITY]? [Promise]"
Subheadline Requirements:
- Reinforce the H1 with a specific proof point or promise
- Address their immediate concern (speed, cost, trust)
- 15-20 words max
Subheadline Formula:
"[Specific proof point]. [Promise]. [Call to action phrase]."
Example:
H1: "Gary's Most Trusted Plumber | 500+ Five-Star Reviews"
Subheadline: "24/7 emergency service with 45-minute average response. Licensed, insured, and guaranteed. Call now."
Generate H1: ___
Generate Subheadline: ___
---
SECTION 2: WHY CHOOSE US (4 Differentiators)
These are the 4 reasons someone should call YOU instead of the next Google result.
Each needs:
- A specific, provable headline (not "Quality Service")
- 1-2 sentences explaining what it means for THEM
Requirements:
- Use numbers when possible (500+ reviews, 45-minute response, $0 trip fee)
- Focus on what THEY get, not what YOU do
- No generic claims like "experienced team" or "customer satisfaction"
GOOD Examples:
- "500+ Five-Star Reviews" → "Our customers rate us 4.9/5 stars across Google, Yelp, and Facebook. See why [CITY] homeowners trust us."
- "$0 Trip Charge" → "We never charge just to show up. You only pay when we do the work — and you'll know the price before we start."
- "45-Minute Average Response" → "When your [problem], you can't wait. We dispatch technicians from [CITY] so you're not waiting hours."
- "Satisfaction Guaranteed" → "Not happy? We'll make it right or you don't pay. No fine print, no hassle."
BAD Examples (never use):
- "Quality Service" — meaningless, everyone says this
- "Experienced Team" — vague, prove it instead
- "Licensed & Insured" — this is table stakes, not a differentiator (use in trust bar, not here)
- "Family Owned Since 2005" — they don't care about your history, they care about their problem
Generate 4 Differentiators:
Differentiator 1:
Headline: ___
Explanation (1-2 sentences): ___
Differentiator 2:
Headline: ___
Explanation (1-2 sentences): ___
Differentiator 3:
Headline: ___
Explanation (1-2 sentences): ___
Differentiator 4:

---
SECTION 3: SECONDARY CATEGORY DESCRIPTIONS
For each SECONDARY CATEGORY in your architecture, write:
- 2-3 sentences describing the category
- Focus on problems you solve, not services you offer
- Include a natural mention of [CITY] or [SERVICE AREA]
Formula:
"[Problem they're experiencing]? [How you solve it]. [Proof point or reassurance]. [Soft CTA]."
Example for "Drain Service":
"Slow drains, backups, and sewer smells aren't just annoying — they're warning signs of bigger problems. Our Gary drain specialists use camera inspection to find the real issue and fix it right the first time. From simple clogs to main line repairs, we handle it all."
Generate for each secondary category:
[CATEGORY 1]: ___
[CATEGORY 2]: ___
[CATEGORY 3]: ___
---
SECTION 4: CORE SERVICE HIGHLIGHTS
For each CORE SERVICE in your architecture, write:
- 3-4 sentences that position this as a specialty
- Include specific details that show expertise
- Address common concerns (cost, time, disruption)
Formula:
"[What the service is and why they need it]. [Why this is complex/important]. [How you handle it differently]. [Reassurance about process/cost/time]."
Example for "Water Heater Replacement":
"Waking up to cold water? A failing water heater needs fast replacement before it floods your home. We stock the most popular models on our trucks for same-day installation. Our technicians will help you choose between traditional and tankless options based on your household size and budget — and we'll haul away your old unit at no extra charge."
Generate for each core service:
[CORE SERVICE 1]: ___
[CORE SERVICE 2]: ___
---
SECTION 5: ABOUT/CREDENTIALS PARAGRAPH
This is NOT a company history. This is a credibility statement.
Requirements:
- 3-4 sentences max
- Lead with what matters to THEM (local, responsive, qualified)
- Include specific credentials (licenses, certifications, years, team size)
- End with commitment/promise
Formula:
"[Who you are in terms of local presence]. [Credentials that matter]. [What you're known for]. [Commitment to them]."
Example:
"Gary Plumbing Pros is a locally owned team of licensed plumbers serving Gary and Northwest Indiana since 2015. Our technicians are background-checked, drug-tested, and trained in the latest techniques. We've built our reputation on showing up when we say we will, charging what we quote, and leaving your home cleaner than we found it."
Generate About Paragraph: ___
---
SECTION 6: FAQ CONTENT (5-6 Questions)
Answer the questions they're thinking but not asking. Focus on:
- Cost concerns
- Timing/scheduling concerns
- Trust/legitimacy concerns
- Process questions
Requirements:
- Questions phrased as the CUSTOMER would ask them
- Answers are direct (answer first, then explain)
- Include specifics where possible
- Each answer 2-4 sentences
GOOD FAQ Examples:
- "How much does [service] cost?" → Direct range or "it depends" with factors explained
- "Do you charge to come out and look?" → Yes/no with explanation
- "How fast can you get here?" → Specific timeframe for normal vs emergency
- "Are your technicians background checked?" → Yes with details on your process
- "What if I'm not happy with the work?" → Your guarantee explained simply
BAD FAQ Examples (never use):
- "Why should I choose [Company Name]?" — too salesy, answers itself
- "What services do you offer?" — that's what the rest of the site is for
- Generic questions no one actually asks
Generate 5-6 FAQs:
Q1: ___
A1: ___
Q2: ___
A2: ___
Q3: ___
A3: ___
Q4: ___
A4: ___
Q5: ___
A5: ___
Q6 (optional): ___
A6: ___
---
SECTION 7: FINAL CTA CONTENT
A short, direct prompt to take action. Not a sales pitch.
Requirements:
- Headline: 5-8 words, action-oriented
- Subtext: 1 sentence addressing urgency or reassurance
- Phone number displayed prominently
Formula:
Headline: "[Problem]? [Solution is one call away]."
Subtext: "[Reassurance about ease/speed/no obligation]."
Example:
Headline: "Plumbing Emergency? We're On Our Way."
Subtext: "Available 24/7. Call now for immediate dispatch to Gary and all of Northwest Indiana."
Generate Final CTA:
Headline: ___
Subtext: ___
=======================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
=======================================================
Once complete, organize all content under clear headings so it can be copied directly into Prompt 3:
HERO CONTENT:
H1: [your H1]
Subheadline: [your subheadline]
WHY CHOOSE US:
[All 4 differentiators with headlines and explanations]
SECONDARY CATEGORIES:
[Category name]: [description]
[repeat for each]
CORE SERVICES:
[Service name]: [description]
[repeat for each]
ABOUT PARAGRAPH:
[your paragraph]
FAQ:
[All Q&As]
FINAL CTA:
Headline: [your headline]
Subtext: [your subtext]
=======================================================
WHAT NOT TO WRITE
=======================================================
- No "Welcome to [Business Name]" — waste of H1 space
- No company founding story in the hero area
- No "We pride ourselves on..." — show don't tell
- No generic differentiators (quality, experience, satisfaction)
- No industry jargon the homeowner won't understand
- No long paragraphs — every sentence must earn its place
- No "Contact us today for all your [industry] needs" — be specific
Generate all content following this framework.

Prompt 3: GBP Landing Page Build Out

I found the original prompts. Now I understand what needs to happen. Looking at Zehl's homepage, here's what makes it crush goal completion:
Zehl's Goal Completion Formula:

1. Hero — Undefeated + Billions Won (immediate credibility, not years in business)
2. Why Hire Us — 4 concrete differentiators (Billions Won, #1 Largest Recoveries, Undefeated, Contingency Fee)
3. Trust Badges — Social proof logos immediately
4. Lead Form — Right there, high on page
5. Video Testimonials — Real clients, massive wall of social proof
6. Then the "Do I have a case?" educational content

They lead with proof not promises. Let me rewrite Prompt 3 with this framework:
